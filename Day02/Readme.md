## ⚙️ Day 02 Focus: Setting Up the Cyber Lab

Today was about preparing the **playground** where all ethical hacking exercises will be done — safely and virtually. The lab setup is crucial for simulating attacks, defenses, and real-world scenarios without touching real networks or systems.

## 📌 Tools Installed Today

### ✅ VirtualBox

* **Purpose:** Creates virtual machines to run guest operating systems.
* **Version Installed:** *Mention version if known*
* **Status:** Installed and running fine on host machine.

### ✅ Kali Linux (ISO)

* **Purpose:** The go-to Linux distribution for penetration testing.
* **Status:** ISO imported into VirtualBox.
* **VM Created:** Yes
* **Booted:** ❌ Not yet booted or installed inside VM.

## 🔧 Current Lab Setup Status

| Component       | Status    | Notes                                  |
| --------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| VirtualBox      | ✅ Done    | Installed and opened successfully      |
| Kali Linux ISO  | ✅ Done    | Downloaded and VM created              |
| Kali Linux Boot | ❌ Not yet | ISO selected, but boot/install pending |

---

## 🧩 Next Steps

* [ ] Boot the Kali VM using the ISO.
* [ ] Complete Kali installation (disk partitioning, user setup).
* [ ] Enable full-screen mode and Guest Additions (optional but improves UX).
* [ ] Start exploring terminal basics and package management.

## 🧠 Learnings Today

* How virtualization works and why it’s safer for cybersecurity testing.
* How to configure a new VM and allocate system resources (RAM, disk).
* Importance of isolating test environments from the host system.

---

## 🧭 My Focus for Tomorrow (Day 03 Preview)


* Complete the full boot and installation of Kali Linux.
* Get familiar with the Kali Linux interface.
* Learn and test first terminal commands.
* Explore default Kali tools briefly (without running anything destructive).
