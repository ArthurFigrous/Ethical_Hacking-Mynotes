# 🛡️ Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking – Day 01 Notes

> **Instructor:** Captain Vaishnavu C V (a.k.a. Vyshu)
> **Track:** Cybersecurity | Ethical Hacking Funda
> **Status:** 📍 Day 01 – Introduction to Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking

---

## 📌 What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks.

> “Cybersecurity is not just a technology issue, but a business and human-centric concern.”

Modern digital life demands constant vigilance—both in defending and ethically testing systems.

## 🔐 Three Key Domains in Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity operations are typically split into three core teams:

### 🔹 1. Blue Team – Defensive Security

* **Goal:** Protect and monitor systems from attacks.
* **Tools:** SIEM, IDS/IPS, EDR, Firewalls
* **Tasks:**

  * Real-time monitoring
  * Log analysis
  * Threat hunting
  * Patching vulnerabilities

### 🔸 2. Red Team – Offensive Security

* **Goal:** Simulate cyberattacks to test system defenses.
* **Tools:** Metasploit, Nmap, Burp Suite, Kali Linux
* **Tasks:**

  * Penetration testing
  * Exploitation
  * Social engineering

### 🟣 3. Purple Team – Collaborative Security

* **Goal:** Bridge between Red and Blue teams.
* **Tasks:**

  * Share tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
  * Coordinate joint simulations
  * Strengthen detection & response processes

## 🧠 Beginner Learning Outcomes – Level 1

By the end of Day 01, I now understand:

* ✅ The core purpose and importance of cybersecurity.
* ✅ The difference between **Blue, Red, and Purple Teams**.
* ✅ Basic examples of tools used in ethical hacking and defense.
* ✅ The value of **ethical responsibility** in cybersecurity.

## 🧰 My Next Steps

* [ ] 🔧 **Set up my lab**: Install VirtualBox and Kali Linux
* [ ] 📖 **Read about famous cyberattacks** and how they were mitigated (e.g., WannaCry, SolarWinds)
* [ ] 📚 **Research and understand these basics:**

  * CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
  * Threat vs Vulnerability vs Exploit
  * Attack vectors and common payload types

---

## 🧭 My Mindset for L1

> ❓ "How can I defend this system?"
> ❓ "Where might it be vulnerable?"

* 🧠 Stay curious
* 🧪 Stay experimental
* 🕵️‍♀️ Stay ethical

This is just the beginning. 🚀 **Cybersecurity is a marathon, not a sprint.**
